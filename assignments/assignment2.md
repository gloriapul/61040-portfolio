## 1. Problem statement
### A problem domain

#### Developing new hobbies.
When I consider my hobbies, I think a lot about how there are many that I have never thought to even explore. My friends have introduced me to interesting ones such as crocheting, which have all been nice opportunities to learn about something new. I always want to make sure that I am open to new hobbies, especially ones that I haven’t heard of, which I am certain is a common feeling among others. Everyone is looking for ways to spend their free time, and it is interesting to see how anything can turn into a hobby, from bird watching to making sourdough bread. 

### A problem

#### Encountering obstacles to mastering a hobby.
People are always searching for something to do and wanting to grow, but most of those same people will also deal with challenges to holding themselves accountable and mastering something. It is something that I am personally interested in as well since I find that like most, once one obstacle comes up, motivation to continue goes down and it leads to a lot of projects being unfinished rather than remaining dedicated to them. 

### A stakeholder list

- College students. College students are a group that deal a lot with this problem as whether it is deadlines, interviews, or a tight budget, they have to be careful with their time and are likely to pick up a hobby and abandon it shortly after
- Parents. Balancing children and a job is difficult and similar to college students, they may find it difficult to commit to a hobby and also have space to do their hobby in their household
- Retired elders. This group has a lot of time but may face this problem due to issues on initially finding a hobby and committing to it as they may feel less overwhelmed and motivated with the abundance of free time and lack of their original routine
Small businesses. Businesses also suffer indirectly from this problem since people may frequently return their items due to being unable to commit to a hobby, which leads to non-increasing sales.
### Evidence and comparables

1. [Hobbytwin](https://hobbytwin.com/) This app solves a similar problem, more so focused on the community aspect of having a hobby by matching people with similar hobbies to become friends and do these hobbies together. There’s also a limitation with the fact that if people get a successful match, there is nothing that will necessarily keep them on the app, which means users will be lost easily and there are also, according to Google Play, not that many users to start with as it indicates 10k+ downloads.
2. [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) This app focuses specifically on getting people into running and keeping them on track, which it successfully does so for many with its “Community-Powered Motivation” plan. This app has the limitation that it may mainly attract already experienced runners and may be less beginner friendly especially after it appears it got rid of its training plan feature.
3. [The Great Hobby Bust: Why we abandoned our lockdown hobby pastimes](https://medium.com/laneway-dispatch/the-great-hobby-bust-why-we-abandoned-our-lockdown-hobby-pastimes-bbbc8bb4aaae)This blog post focuses specifically on the pandemic and possible causes as to why people left behind their hobbies, including the idea of hustle culture and the need for strict productivity. These are the types of users that are affected by the problem of committing to a hobby and by including badges and other gamification elements in an app, it could assist with many people's need to feel productive.
4. [Hobbies of America in 2024: Understanding passions across the country](https://aytm.com/post/hobbies-survey) This report provides insight into results from a survey of 1,000 Americans regarding their interest in hobbies, 15% of which reported not even having one. The hobbies mentioned included “playing various types of video games, reading, gardening, watching movies and tv, listening to music, photography, cooking, jewelry making, hiking, sewing, crocheting, writing, painting, coin collecting, and fishing,” which provides insights what kinds of hobbies people are interested in and what could be supported in an app.
5. [3 proven health benefits of having a hobby](https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/3-proven-health-benefits-having-hobby)  This article highlights the mental and physical benefits of having a hobby, including improved cognitive function and a lower risk of chronic disease, which supports why this problem of finding hobbies does matter.


## Application pitch
### A name

HobbySprout
### A motivation
This application is designed to target people who, for any reason, are unable to commit to a hobby and need an external force to hold them accountable for making progress, leading to improved wellbeing and productivity. 
### Key features
1. Join a community: This feature could allow directly impacted stakeholders of all backgrounds to submit any questions or concerns into a group that is also looking to develop that same hobby. Regardless of whatever barrier they are facing, it encourages them to stay on track and also encourages human interaction and collaboration as well as builds a sense of community, which will also draw the user to the app.
2. Milestones: This feature could include some gamification through milestones to get to master a hobby by allowing users to input some initial goals, then having the option to use those goals or have a more personalized plan using AI. This would break down some plan a user has for their goal and makes it more manageable to stay dedicated, which is something all of the stakeholders would end up benefiting from as it removes that barrier of knowing where to even start or how to proceed. 
3. Hobby matchmaker quiz: As a way to target users who may not have an idea on what they are interested in yet, this quiz would match them, using AI for the results, to indicate which category is most appropriate for them. This feature would help users narrow down their focus and not lose themself in indecision, which is another way of approaching this problem. It would also benefit indirect stakeholders such as business owners who will benefit if these users are matched with more expensive hobbies.
